Staking with the Poolsea network is very flexible and unlike any other staking infrastructure for Ethereum 2.0 to date. When depositing PLS into the Poolsea smart contracts, you will be instantly issued a token called rPLS which represents a tokenised staking deposit in the network. Its value and the rewards it gains over time will be reflected by the work each individual decentralised node operator gives the Poolsea network. Poolseaâ€™s unique decentralised staking infrastructure is economically bonded to both be secure and scalable.

# Test Poolsea

To see Poolsea in action, clone the repo and run the test suite with the following commands:
```bash
